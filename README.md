# Automatic weapon detection alarm system
Violence, assaults, thefts, and other violent situations are closely related to weapon use. Prevention via early detection is essential for reducing these phenomena. 
This project presents an automatic cold steel weapon detection system for control and monitoring in the field of video surveillance.

We have built the key training dataset guided by the performance of a CNN classification model. Among the currently influential detection models, the most promising results in surveillance videos in indoor scenarios were obtained by the Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN).

The final detection model provides excellent results not only as cold steel weapon detector but also as automatic alarm system in video surveillance.

Abailable resouces in this repository:
* **[Automatic alarm system sequences](https://github.com/alcasla/Automatic-Cold-Steel-Detection-Alarm/blob/master/Automatic-alarm-system-AATpI.md)** Videos analyzed to get the AATpI(Alarm Activation Time per Interval). It is the average time from appear a viewable cold steel weapon to the system activates the alarm.
* **[Automatic alarm system pilot test](https://github.com/alcasla/Automatic-Cold-Steel-Detection-Alarm/tree/master/Automatic-alarm-system-AATpI-v0.1)** Sequences obtained from YouTube and recorded videos used in pilot test stage.
* **[Demostration videos](https://github.com/alcasla/Automatic-Cold-Steel-Detection-Alarm/tree/master/demo)** Show some capabilities developed or improved.
