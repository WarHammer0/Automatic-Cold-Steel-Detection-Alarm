# Cold steel weapon detector as automatic alarm system
The detection system must activate the alarm only when it is completely confident about the presence of one or more weapons in the scene.
We have analyzed the suitability of our cold steel weapon detector as an automatica detection alarm system. Using the metric AATpI(Alarm Activation Time per Interval). We obtain the time rate in a set of surveillance video sequences in order to determinate the average time that system needs to activate alarm.

Then, table below shows AATpI for each video and the link to watch the result.

The average AATpI=0.41s(with preprocessed stage for adverse brightness conditions) which means that the system responds with an alert much faster than the human eye from a security agent. This system represents a helpful tool for monitoring or filter violence for social network, films, thus prevent by early detection.

The playback speed is 5fps (frames per second) to appreciate every frame outcome but the system performs considerably higher fps. During the video playback the frames which activate alarm are showed slowly and finally raise the alarm visualizing a color filter.
